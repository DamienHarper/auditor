## What is auditor?

**auditor** is a PHP library that provides an easy and standardized way to collect audit logs. It is designed to track changes made to your entities and persist them as audit trails.

### Key Features

- 📝 **Automatic change tracking** - Captures inserts, updates, and deletes automatically
- 🔗 **Relationship tracking** - Records many-to-many associations and dissociations
- 👤 **User attribution** - Records who made the changes and their IP address
- 🔒 **Transactional integrity** - Audit entries are inserted within the same database transaction
- 🎯 **Flexible configuration** - Choose which entities and fields to audit
- 🔐 **Security controls** - Define who can view audit logs
- 🗄️ **Multi-database support** - Store audits in separate databases if needed

## Architecture Overview

The library is architected around two core concepts:

1. **Auditing Services** - Responsible for collecting audit events when changes occur
2. **Storage Services** - Responsible for persisting audit traces to the database

These services are provided by **Providers**. The library ships with a default provider for Doctrine ORM.

            TP["TransactionProcessor
            Track inserts, updates, deletes, relations
            Build payload (diffs, blame, extra_data = null)"]
        end

        subgraph EVENTS["EventDispatcher"]
            direction TB
            TP --> LE

            LE["LifecycleEvent
            payload (diffs, blame, extra_data)
            entity (the audited object)"]

            LE --> LISTENER

            LISTENER["Your Listener(s) — optional
            Enrich extra_data from entity state"]:::optional
        end
    end

    LISTENER --> DB

    DB[("Audit Tables
    users_audit, posts_audit, ...
    Columns: type, diffs, extra_data, blame, ...")]

    classDef optional stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

### Data Flow

1. **Entity Change** → Your application modifies an entity via Doctrine
2. **Detection** → `AuditingService` detects the change through Doctrine events
3. **Processing** → `TransactionProcessor` computes diffs and prepares audit data (with `extra_data = null`)
4. **Event** → A `LifecycleEvent` is dispatched with the audit payload and the entity object
5. **Enrichment** *(optional)* → Your listener(s) inspect the entity and populate `extra_data` in the payload
6. **Persistence** → `StorageService` persists the audit entry to the database

## Supported Databases

The DoctrineProvider supports the following RDBMS:

| Database   | Support Level |
|------------|---------------|
| MySQL      | ✅ Full       |
| MariaDB    | ✅ Full       |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ Full       |
| SQLite     | ✅ Full       |

> [!NOTE]
> The DoctrineProvider should work with any database supported by Doctrine, though only the above are actively tested.
